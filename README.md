# ray-tracing
My realisation of ray tracing in rust

## Running
I'm building project only for mac os, and to run my app, you need to fix it (idk why):
```xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ray-tracing```.
If you using other OS, you need to build it by yourself.

### v0.0.1

v0.0.1 Renderer image.

Here I realised simple window creator, and filling VRAM with simple gradient.
